    <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
     <p>
        We envision a world where survivors have sustaining income, savings and credit with which to build wealth and the resources to support individual, intergenerational and community healing.
        We envision a world where harm-doers are held financially accountable and survivors are not saddled with the cost of being harmed. 
        We envision a world where gender-based violence receives the attention necessary to address it as a systemic issue. </p>

    Our goal is not just survival but safety. 
    Our goal is not just living but thriving. 
    Our goal is not just making ends meet but creating wealth and abundance.</p>
